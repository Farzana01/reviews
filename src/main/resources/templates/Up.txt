A feisty septuagenarian teams with a fearless wilderness ranger to do battle with a vicious band of beasts and villains 
in this computer-animated adventure scripted by Pixar veteran Bob Peterson and co-directed by Peterson and Monsters, Inc. 
director Peter Docter. Carl Fredricksen is a 78-year-old balloon salesman. His entire life, Carl has longed to wander the 
wilds of South America. Then, one day, the irascible senior citizen shocks his neighbors by tying thousands of balloons to 
his home and finally taking flight. But Carl isn't alone on his once-in-a-lifetime journey, because stowed away on his 
front porch is an excitable eight-year-old wilderness explorer named Russell. Later, as the house touches down on the 
world's second largest continent, Carl and his unlikely traveling companion step outside to discover that not only is 
their new front lawn considerably larger, but that the predators therein are much more ferocious than anything they ever 
faced back home.
